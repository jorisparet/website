    location: Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France
    date_start: '2023-02-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-

        Contributed to ITER, the world’s largest international scientific collaboration, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale clean energy from nuclear fusion. Designed a machine-learning-based calibration strategy for ANSYS finite-element models using Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes. Developed anomaly detection algorithms for predictive maintenance, enabling intershot and real-time monitoring. Contributed to the Tokamak Systems Monitor software, including version control and data handling (Git, DVC). Administered the team's multi-GPU compute server. Presented results at international conferences (SOFT, SOFE) and workshops (Fusion for Energy AI Workshop). Explored LLMs for automated tokamak operation reporting. Co-supervised interns and supported external contributors.

    description: |2-

        Research on the emergence of local order in disordered materials such as glasses and supercooled liquids using molecular dynamics simulations, unsupervised machine learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, autoencoders), and information theory. Developed a fully documented open-source Python package (partycls) for machine-learning-based structural analysis, with CI/CD integration. Ran large-scale simulations on CPU and GPU clusters. Presented work at international conferences and workshops. Delivered 200+ hours of undergraduate teaching in physics and programming.
